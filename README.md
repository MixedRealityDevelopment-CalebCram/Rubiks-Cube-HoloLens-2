# Rubik's Cube - HoloLens 2
 
This is an implementation of Felix Roh's Famous Cube project originally built for NReal light and adapted to the Quest 2 utilizing Mixed Reality Passthrough. Shoutout to Marc Frances for getting this hammered onto the Quest 2 platform. NOTE: Currently the build settings are set to HoloLens 2, but can be easily adapted to Quest 2 with some settings changes.
